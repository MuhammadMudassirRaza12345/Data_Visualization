## 1- line plot :
> A Line plot can be defined as a graph that displays data as points or check marks above a number line, showing the frequency of each value. 

>Library used : matplotlib ,seaborn

 ## 2- bar plot : 
>A barplot (or barchart) is one of the most common types of graphic. It shows the relationship between a numeric and a categoric variable. Each entity of the categoric variable is represented as a bar. The size of the bar represents its numeric value. 
>Library used : matplotlib ,seaborn

## 3- box plot :   
>A box plot or boxplot is a method for graphically demonstrating the locality, spread and skewness groups of numerical data through their quartiles.  

>Library used :  seaborn 
 
>For View Code [Click here](./03_boxplot.ipynb)  

## 4- other plot:   
>Like : replot ,violinplot,boxplot,scatterplot,stripplot,
boxenplot,pair plot etc. 

>Library used : seaborn ,pandas ,Numpy

## 5- plotly :
>The plotly Python library is an interactive, open-source plotting library that supports over 40 unique chart types covering a wide range of statistical, financial, geographic, scientific, and 3-dimensional use-cases.Plotly's Python graphing library makes interactive, publication-quality graphs.

## 6- Numpy :
>**What is NumPy?** \
>NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.
It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. It is an open source project and you can use it freely.

>**Why Use NumPy?** \
In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.The array object in NumPy is called ndarray, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy.
Arrays are very frequently used in data science, where speed and resources are very important.\
**NumPy stands for Numerical Python.**

## 7- Pandas  :  
> **What is Pandas?** \
Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets.
It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.The name **"Pandas"** has a reference to both **"Panel Data"**, and **"Python Data Analysis"** and was created by Wes McKinney in 2008.

>**Why Use Pandas?**\
Pandas allows us to analyze big data and make conclusions based on statistical theories.Pandas can clean messy data sets, and make them readable and relevant.
Relevant data is very important in data science.
